          <p>
            First and foremost, I love to learn, especially concepts and tools I
            can use to build productive applications. I find developing
            front-end and back-end aspects equally fulfilling, as I believe user
            experience is just as important as the programming logic behind the
            application itself. However, it is a personal goal of mine to create
            apps that improve not only the experience, but the lives of those
            that use them.
